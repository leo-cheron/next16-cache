# Bug Report: `use cache` Directive Ignored in Dynamic Routes in Production

## Description

The `'use cache'` directive is being ignored when used in dynamic routes (routes with dynamic segments like `[locale]`, `[slug]`, etc.) after building and deploying to production on Vercel. The caching behavior works correctly during local development (`npm run dev`), but fails silently once the application is deployed.

## Environment

- **Next.js Version**: 16.0.0
- **React Version**: 19.2.0
- **Node Version**: 22
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel
- **Next.js Config**: `cacheComponents: true` enabled in `next.config.ts`

## Reproduction

### Repository
This issue can be reproduced using a test repository that demonstrates the problem: [Add your repo URL here]

### Code Example

**File: `app/[locale]/static/page.tsx`** (Works correctly)
```tsx
'use cache'

import {fakeAwait} from '@/utils/fakeAwait';
import Image from "next/image";

const Home = async ({ params }: { params: { locale: string } }) => {
  params = await params;
  await fakeAwait(2000);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>locale: {params.locale}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home;
```

**File: `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`** (Cache ignored in production)
```tsx
'use cache'

import {Suspense} from 'react';
import {fakeAwait} from '@/utils/fakeAwait';

export default async function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  await fakeAwait(1000);

  return <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading page...</div>}>{children}</Suspense>
}
```

**File: `next.config.ts`**
```ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Next.js 16 app with dynamic routes (e.g., `app/[locale]/page.tsx`)
2. Add the `'use cache'` directive at the top of the page or layout component
3. Include async data fetching or delays to observe caching behavior
4. Run locally with `bun run dev`:
   - Navigate to `/en`, `/fr`, etc.
   - Refresh the page multiple times
   - **✅ Expected**: After first load, subsequent refreshes use cached data (instant load)
   - **✅ Actual**: Cache works correctly, pages load instantly on refresh
5. Build and deploy to production:
6. Navigate to the same dynamic routes in production
7. Refresh the page multiple times
   - **✅ Expected**: Cached data should be used, instant load times
   - **❌ Actual**: Every refresh re-executes the entire component, ignoring the cache completely

## Expected Behavior

When `'use cache'` is used in a dynamic route:
- The component/data should be cached after the first render
- Subsequent requests to the same route (e.g., `/en`, `/fr`) should serve from cache
- This behavior should be consistent between development and production environments

## Actual Behavior

**Local Development (`npm run dev`)**: ✅ Works as expected
- Cache is respected
- Subsequent page loads are instant
- `fakeAwait(1000)` delay only happens on first load

**Production Build (`npm run build` + `npm start` or Vercel deployment)**: ❌ Broken
- Cache is completely ignored
- Every page refresh re-executes the entire component
- `fakeAwait(1000)` delay happens on EVERY refresh
- Suspense fallbacks are shown on every navigation/refresh

## Observations

1. **Static pages without dynamic segments** using `'use cache'` work correctly in both dev and production
2. **Dynamic route segments** (`[locale]`, `[slug]`, etc.) cause the cache to be ignored in production
3. The build completes successfully with no warnings or errors about cache usage
4. No runtime errors in production console - the cache is silently ignored
5. This affects both page components and layout components in dynamic routes

## Impact

This makes the `'use cache'` directive essentially unusable for any real-world application that uses dynamic routing, which is a core Next.js feature. Applications expecting cached performance get degraded user experience with repeated loading states and data fetching.

## Workaround

Currently, the only workaround is to:
1. Avoid using `'use cache'` in dynamic routes
2. Move caching logic to separate cached functions outside the component
3. Use traditional React Server Components caching strategies instead

However, this defeats the purpose of the `'use cache'` directive and its advertised simplicity.

## Additional Context

- This repository was created specifically to test and demonstrate this issue
- The issue is reproducible 100% of the time in production
- No amount of cache configuration (`cacheComponents`, `cacheLife`, etc.) resolves the issue
- The behavior suggests that Next.js may be treating all dynamic routes as completely dynamic in production, regardless of the `'use cache'` directive

## Questions

1. Is `'use cache'` intended to work with dynamic routes in production?
2. If so, is there additional configuration required beyond the directive itself?
3. Is this a known limitation that should be documented?
4. Are there plans to support this use case?
